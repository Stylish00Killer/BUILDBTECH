Below is an example project prompt along with sample files (a `requirements.txt` and a `README.md`) that clean up the code and detail how to install dependencies, run the app locally, and build an executable file for Windows.

---

### **Project Prompt**

**Objective:**  
Develop a fully functional version of the BUILDBTECH app. Clean up the code, enforce coding standards, and add comprehensive documentation and unit tests. The app should be deployable via GitHub and runnable on localhost. Additionally, include a process to package the app into an executable file (using PyInstaller) for ease of distribution.

**Requirements:**

- **Code Clean-Up:**  
  - Refactor and organize code into clear modules (e.g., separate the AI logic, API endpoints, and UI components).
  - Follow Python PEP8 guidelines and use linters (e.g., flake8) for consistency.
  - Write unit tests for core functionalities.

- **GitHub Repository:**  
  - Upload the cleaned and documented code to GitHub.
  - Include clear instructions in the README on how to install dependencies, run the app locally, and build an executable.

- **Local Execution:**  
  - Provide a step-by-step process from cloning the repository to running the app on localhost.
  - Offer an option to build an executable file (using PyInstaller) so users can run the app without needing a full Python environment.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Create a `README.md` with sections on Overview, Setup, Installation, Usage, and Build Instructions.
  - Include a `requirements.txt` file listing all necessary Python packages.
